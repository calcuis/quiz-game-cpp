## Quiz Game
The given C++ code is similar to the previous C code, but it utilizes C++ features and libraries. It is also a quiz game that asks multiple-choice questions, checks the user's answers, and calculates the score. Additionally, it stores the user's answers and the final score in a file named "results.txt".

Let's go through the code step by step:

Include the necessary header file:
```
#include <iostream>
```
This line includes the <iostream> header, which provides input/output operations for C++.

Define arrays to store questions, options, and answer key:
```
std::string questions[] = {"1. What year did the C language debut?: ",
                           "2. Who is credited with creating C?: ",
                           "3. Python is written by which language?: "};

std::string options[][4] = {"A. 1969", "B. 1972", "C. 1975", "D. 1999",
                            "A. Dennis Ritchie", "B. Bill Gate", "C. Tim Cook", "D. Elon Musk",
                            "A. C", "B. C+", "C. C++", "D. C#"};

char answerKey[] = {'B', 'A', 'A'};
```
These arrays are similar to the previous code. The questions array stores the questions as strings, the options array stores the options for each question as a 2D array of strings, and the answerKey array stores the correct answers as characters.

Declare variables for user input and score:
```
char guess;
int score;
```
The guess variable stores the user's answer for each question, and the score variable keeps track of the number of correct answers.

Print the game title and open a file for writing:
```
std::cout << "************** QUIZ GAME ***************\n";
FILE *pF = fopen("results.txt", "w");
```
This line prints the title of the game using std::cout. The fopen function opens the file "results.txt" in write mode and returns a pointer to the file (pF).

Start a loop to ask questions:
```
std::cout << "****************************************\n";
std::cout << questions[i] << '\n';
std::cout << "****************************************\n";

for(int j = 0; j < sizeof(options[i])/sizeof(options[i][0]); j++){
    std::cout << options[i][j] << '\n';
}
```
This loop iterates through each question.

Print the current question and options:
```
std::cout << "****************************************\n";
std::cout << questions[i] << '\n';
std::cout << "****************************************\n";

for(int j = 0; j < sizeof(options[i])/sizeof(options[i][0]); j++){
    std::cout << options[i][j] << '\n';
}
```
These lines use std::cout to print the current question and its options. The question is printed using the std::string from the questions array, and the options are printed using a nested loop. The j loop iterates over the options for the current question.

Get user's answer and check for correctness:
```
std::cout << "Guess: ";
std::cin >> guess;
guess = toupper(guess);
fprintf(pF, "%c\n", guess);

if(guess == answerKey[i]){
    std::cout << "CORRECT\n";
    score++;
}
else{
    std::cout << "WRONG!\n";
    std::cout << "Answer: " << answerKey[i] << '\n';
}
```
These lines use std::cin to read the user's answer and store it in the guess variable. The toupper function is then used to convert the user's answer to uppercase. The user's answer is stored in the file using fprintf.

The code then compares the user's answer (guess) with the correct answer (answerKey[i]) for the current question. If they match, the user's answer is correct, and the score is incremented. Otherwise, the answer is wrong, and the correct answer is displayed using std::cout.

Print the final score and close the file:
```
std::cout << "**************************\n";
std::cout << "**       RESULTS        **\n";
std::cout << "**************************\n";
std::cout << "CORRECT GUESSES: " << score << '\n';
std::cout << "NUMBER of QUESTIONS: " << size << '\n';
std::cout << "SCORE: " << (score/(double)size)*100 << "%";

fprintf(pF, "FINAL SCORE: %d/%d", score, size);

return 0;
```
These lines use std::cout to print the final score and results. The number of correct guesses (score), the number of questions (size), and the calculated score percentage are displayed. The final score is also written to the file using fprintf. Finally, the function returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.

Overall, this code is a C++ implementation of a quiz game that functions similarly to the previous C code. It utilizes C++ features, such as std::string for question and option storage and std::cin and std::cout for input and output operations. The file handling is done using C-style FILE pointers and the fopen and fprintf functions.
